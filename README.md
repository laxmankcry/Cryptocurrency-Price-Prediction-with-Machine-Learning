Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with Machine Learning

I’ll start the task of Cryptocurrency price prediction by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset we need. For this task, I will collect the latest Bitcoin prices data from Yahoo Finance, using the yfinance API. This will help us collect the latest data each time you run this code.

Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model
Predicting the future prices of cryptocurrency is based on the problem of Time series analysis. The AutoTS library in Python is one of the best libraries for time series analysis. So here I will be using the AutoTS library to predict the bitcoin prices for the next 30 days.

Summary
Buying and selling result in a change in the price of any cryptocurrency, but buying and selling trends depend on many factors. Using machine learning for cryptocurrency price prediction can only work in situations where prices change due to historical prices that people see before buying and selling their cryptocurrency.
